# satan-mcnice

A vertical slice of a 2D adventure point-n-click game made in 2016. It was created as a learning experience in Unity by me (Oscar MÃ¥rtensson) and Marcus Johansson. 

The game is played as Satan McNice - a hard-boiled cop - as he receives a distress call from nearby Old McDonald's farm to investigate a potential crime.

The lastest Unity version that has been confirmed to work with the game is 2018.3.0f2. Not tested with newer versions than that.
